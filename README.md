# Kalman-Filter
Kalman Filter based project

This repository contains various implementations of Kalman Filter for different use cases, including filtering, prediction, and state estimation

Projects Included:<br />
✅ Basic Kalman Filter (KF) – A simple implementation to understand the core concepts<br />
✅ Extended Kalman Filter (EKF) – Handling nonlinear systems with Jacobian approximation<br />
✅ Ensemble Kalman Filter (EnKF) – A Monte Carlo-based method for high-dimensional state estimation<br />
✅ Unscented Kalman Filter (UKF) – An advanced approach for highly nonlinear systems<br />
✅ Adaptive Kalman Filter (AKF) – A variant that dynamically adjusts noise parameters for improved performance<br />
